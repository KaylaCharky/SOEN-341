Instagram is a social media platform for the sharing of pictures and moments that people enjoy. This web application allows for the user to post pictures, follow other user's profile's to see all their friend's pictures and like or comment on the photos to show appreciation. The three core features of the application were the ability to post a picture to their profile, comment on another user's picture and a certain user needs to be able to follow another user. The additional features decided by the team were the ability for a user to update his/her profile information, which includes updating their profile picture and also their username if they are willing to.

# Technologies
This project was initially started in React, Node.j. As the project progressed, it became difficult to implement many features into the project because of the lack of knowledge in those languages. Later on, the technologies chosen by the team were:
* FrontEnd - HTML5, Jinja 2, bootstrap
* Backend - Flask, Python
Also, additional technologies used were:
* SQLalchemy
* Bcrypt
* Login
